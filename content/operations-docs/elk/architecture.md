This course is not a "what is Elasticsearch" introduction — the internet has plenty of those. It's a hands-on operations guide: you deploy real clusters, configure them correctly, secure them, feed data in, and keep them running.

The interactive walkthrough below shows exactly what you'll be doing across each phase.

___COURSE_JOURNEY_DEMO___

## What this course is not

- A deep-dive into query DSL or search relevance tuning
- A beginner programming course
- Theory-heavy documentation

Every lesson follows a lab pattern: download config files, run commands, observe the result, understand what happened.

## Prerequisites

You'll get the most out of this course if you're comfortable with:

- Linux command line (navigate, edit files, run commands)
- Docker and Docker Compose (pull images, run containers)
- Basic JSON (read and write key-value structures)
- REST APIs (what a `curl -X GET` does)

## Next Steps

- [Single Node Setup](./single-node/01-single-node-setup) — first thing to run
